# Dog vs Cat Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform binary image classification: determining whether an image contains a dog or a cat. The project is built using **TensorFlow/Keras**, two of the most popular libraries for building deep learning models. It is designed to classify images from the widely available **Dogs vs Cats** dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can classify images as either a dog or a cat. Image classification is one of the core tasks in the field of computer vision, and CNNs have proven to be extremely effective in solving such tasks by mimicking the visual processing techniques of the human brain.

### **Project Description**

This project involves the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the **Dogs vs Cats** dataset, which consists of thousands of images labeled as "dog" or "cat." CNNs are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for image recognition tasks. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers that automatically learn the features of the images, such as edges, textures, and shapes, to make accurate predictions.

The dataset is divided into two main directories: **train** and **test**. The **train** directory is used for training the model, while the **test** directory is used to evaluate its performance on new, unseen images. The images are preprocessed to normalize their pixel values, and various data augmentation techniques (such as flipping, rotating, and rescaling) are used to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model’s ability to generalize.

Once the model is trained, it is saved in the **H5** format and can be used to make predictions on new images. The model's performance is tracked using accuracy and loss metrics, which are displayed at the end of each epoch during training.

The **Dogs vs Cats** dataset is well-known in the deep learning community, making it an excellent dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of CNNs. The model built in this project can be used as a starting point for more complex computer vision tasks or further fine-tuned for other applications in the field of image recognition.

### **Key Features:**
- **Binary Classification**: The model classifies images into two categories: Dog and Cat.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The images are preprocessed using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator` to normalize pixel values and apply real-time data augmentation.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is used to automatically learn the features from the images.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: The model is trained for multiple epochs, and both training and validation accuracy/loss are tracked to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Visualization**: Training history (accuracy and loss over epochs) is visualized using Matplotlib to help diagnose the model’s learning process.
- **Inference**: After training, the model is used to predict whether a new image contains a dog or a cat.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Framework used to build and train the deep learning model.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries used for visualizing training/validation metrics and model performance.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Libraries used for data manipulation and handling arrays.
- **scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning functionalities and metrics.
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the solution.
